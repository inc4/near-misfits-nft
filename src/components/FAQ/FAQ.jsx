            <p className="faq__item-text">
              An NFT stands for “Non-fungible token” and is a fancy way of
              saying it’s a unique, one of a kind digital item that users can
              buy, own, and trade. Some NFTs main function are to be digital art
              and look cool, some offer additional utility like exclusive access
              to websites or participation in an event, think of it like a rare
              piece of art that can also act as a “members” card.

              Yes! Near Misfits is an exclusive, limited collection of only 1923
              NFTs. There may be more Generations to be released afterwards with
              cool features - such as composability - and, of course, special
              perks for Gen 0 Misfits *wink*.

            <h3 className="faq__item-title">What is the Metaverse?</h3>
            <p className="faq__item-text">
              The Metaverse refers to a shared virtual experience where land,
              avatars and names can be bought and sold, often using
              cryptocurrency. The NEAR is growing fast and shaping up to be the
              host of rich Metaverse with games and other virtual experiences.

              What can I do with my NEAR Misfit?
            </h3>
            <p className="faq__item-text">
              You are free to do anything with them under a non-exclusive
              license. We encourage you to display them loud and proud as your
              social media Avatar (Twitter, Discord, etc.) and SOON you will be
              able to use it on the growing Metaverse on NEAR.

              Are NEAR Misfits a good investment?
            </h3>
            <p className="faq__item-text">
              That is ultimately a decision for you to make. We have created
              NEAR Misfits to be the best version of yourself as you enter the
              NEAR Metaverse. We believe NEAR Misfits have an exciting future
              ahead of them as Misfits grow into an active community of early
              adopters and contributors and as the NEAR ecosystem grows - there
              could be a lot more people wanting to join the Misfits party than
              Misfits available. Be mindful that, ultimately, the success of
              NEAR Misfits relies on many, many factors and variables, hard to
              tell with certainty what could happen in the future! Hopefully
              NEAR Misfits go to the moon, but like anything in life, don’t
              spend money you can’t afford to not have, and enjoy the journey!

            <h3 className="faq__item-title">Why do we need royalties?</h3>
            <p className="faq__item-text">
              The amount of royalties is fixed at 15% to finance the future
              developments of NEAR Misfits. We are very ambitious and have plans
              to run a series of projects and events around to world to grow and
              strengthen the NEAR ecosystem.
